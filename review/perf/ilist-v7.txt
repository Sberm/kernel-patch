hitting enter in searching activates an event
if not run in root, then it won't open the event

execution procedures:
sudo -s
source /home/howard/venv/bin/activate
pip install textual
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/perf/python python/ilist.py

If it could expand to the full height in the left window when not collecting events, it'd be better

Is there a way to pause the event collection?

sparkline's height can be bigger

If this is an interactive command that collects the count of events why not name it istat? ilist sounds like merely reading the menu without ordering

> [11] As some PMUs have hundreds of events a 'c'
key will collapse the events in the current PMU to make navigating the
PMUs easier.
that's why it should show the whole thing at first, or there should be an exit mode where I
can scroll through the list of events, small height makes me forget the parent-child relation

Some people are using terminal in vscode, and caret-q is occupied, I'd image for emacs users this is entering raw character, so it doesn't work in eterm either, why not just q?

== review ==

don't think this is needed: (04)
+		if (ret)
+			break;


Name of the PMU including suffixes
should be ("General information about the pmu")
